# â˜‘ ToDo web application - Spring Boot App 

This is a personal project I built with the purpose of learning more about Java, JPA, Login/Registration (Security), and Spring Boot. 
It's a simple web application for keeping record of daily tasks.

You can register and start creating TODOs through this web: https://todoapp-dante.herokuapp.com/ (don't worry, the password is not stored in plain text ðŸ˜‰)
